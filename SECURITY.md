# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please [privately report it via the Security tab](https://github.com/RondaYummy/swift-i18n/security/advisories/new) on the correct GitHub repository (see [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)). If that is impossible, feel free to send an email to halevych.dev@gmail.com instead.

RondoYummy will coordinate the fix and disclosure. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly verified and addressed.
